# PIXAPoLY-PMX
PIXAPoLY PMX (PrinterManagementX) An All-In-One 3D Printer Job Management Software. Lightweight and portable, PMX helps time and keep track of large 3D printing Jobs lists, so you can 3D print in bulk without worry. PIXAPoLY PMX is made with HTML and Javascript, so it can run in any browser. The instructions and usage guide on PMX is below.

# Editing Bill of Materials:
Before you start printing, the bill of materials (BOM) needs to be generated. Click "Edit BOM" and then type the name of thee objects you will be printing. This can be anything short, but must be remembered for later when adding print jobs. Then type the TOTAL amount of objects you want to print, not just a single batch but the end goal (eg. 80 with batches of 10 each). After, the BOM should be automatically generated and items are crossed off and removed as the print Jobs are finished. Next, it's time to add the print jobs.

# Adding/Setup Print Jobs:
It is reccomended to add at least one offset print job, so the first job can be timed. To do this first, click "Add to print jobs" to add a print job and type N/A, then 0, then 0. Next you can add the rest of the print jobs. It is good practice to add the amount you are currently 3D printing. For example, say you had to print 20 total objects and you were printing the first 1 - 10 on the first batch, then you would type the job name you set on the BOM earlier, followed by the lower range (eg. 1) then the higher range (eg. 10) so it would look like this wheen added: "1-10 JobName". Next, follow the job control panel section to run the timer.

# Job Control Panel:
The print information panel is the top left panel that shows the total elapsed time for the current job, and the upcoming job. The job control panel is the window with the traffic light on the left side of the screen. It has the Job control buttons used to run PMX. Click NEXT to get rid of the first N/A print job, then simply start your first print job on your 3D printer, then click NEXT. Then click continue to start the first print job. after the prints are done with the first job, click next and remove them from the bed before clicking continue. If thee printer needs to be paused, you can pause thee elapsed job time by clicking BREAK in the control panel. If a printing error occurs and the print job needs to be stopped entirely click STOP.

# Changing Views
A simple monitoring view is availiblee as well. When not using the controls, click "Change View" and the grey simple verion of the control panel will appear. To go back to the main screen, click "Return to controller".

Hope you enjoy using PMX!
